# TO DO LIST

> "To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. I will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and I will do it using ES6 and Webpack!
>  I will build a very simple yet powerful to-do list. It will be inspired by the minimalist website. That website is already offline but you can still play with thanks to [web.archive.org](web.archive.org).
