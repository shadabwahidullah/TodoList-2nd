# Webpack Boiler plate

> this is a boiler plate for starting a project that I will configure webpack in it.
>  When working on the project you will not want to run the build command from the terminal every time you make a change in the code. Therefore I will install a webpack dev server, which will watch my source files, generate compiled distribution files and even refresh the browser every time I save changes in the source code.

## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
clone the project and you can start your own project on it.
